-----------------------------------UC1 calculate length-----------------------------------
As a fan of geometry, I want to
model a line based on a point
consisting of (x, y) co-ordinates using the Cartesian system, So that I can calculate its length.

- A Length as 2 Points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) - Length of a Line = sqrt( (x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2- y1) ^ 2)

Explaination
-In this use case you have to calculate lenght of one line so we need x1,x2,y1,y2
so take input from user and calculate length
so calculate this we have to substract x2-x1 and then find the power of the result of (x2-x1)
like this for y coordinate
substract y2-y1 and then find the power of the result of(y2-y1)

Math.Sqrt-is a Math class method which is used to calculate the square root of the specified number.
Math.Pow-used to find power
Math.round-used to display how many decimal points you want.



---------------------------------UC2 Check Equality-----------------------------------------
Check euqality of two lines
use Equals method to check equality of two lines
